#About
**Banasthalite Online Exchange Market** is a web application for easy exchange of
goods i.e. second hand books,stationary materials etc among students of
Banasthali. The website is developed for two types of users – sellers and
buyers(both are the students of Banasthali).A student can act as a seller, or as a
buyer or both but in only one role at a time.Our website will act as a medium
among the students for purpose of exchanging goods and indirectly help them in
purchasing, selling and renting goods.The aim of this project
is to reduce the efforts of selling and buying among students and provide them the
ease for renting their items as well. Students can easily search for items of their
need and accordingly interact with the seller.

##Techenology Used
It is a dynamic website developed using
JSP. The content displayed on the website is dynamically generated, depending on
the requests sent from the client’s browser. It uses both client-side scripting and
server-side scripting. Client-side scripting is achieved by the use of HTML, CSS
and JavaScript. It is used for customizing the display (different for each student).
Server- side scripting is achieved through JSP and is used for form processing,
building and displaying pages created from the database.
